---

### 10th October 2024 (Thursday)
- **Notes**: Background Research: Computational Electromagnetics 
- **Tasks**: Referred to lecture notes of Electromagnetics 3 and Radio Frequency
- **Progress**: Read the background material and met with Prof. Nick, got the analytical simulation on MATLAB
- **Reflection**: Tried different inputs such as different shapes/size and resolution

---

### 17th October 2024 (Thursday)
- **Notes**: Introduction to NVIDIA Modulus 
- **Tasks**: Revise PyTorch skills
- **Progress**: Completed
- **Reflection**: Practised and warmed up PyTorch 

---

### 24th October 2024 (Thursday)

- **Tasks**: 
- **Progress**: Got familiar with SLURM and Shannon
- **Reflection**: 

---

### 31st October 2024 (Thursday)
- **Notes**: Presentation
- **Tasks**: Prepare slides based on the background material for the presentation
- **Progress**: The presentation 
- **Reflection**: Focus more on the plan, over the theory for the presentation

---

### 8th November 2024 (Friday)
- **Notes**: Memory and scaling
- **Tasks**: Show professor about 1D implementation
- **Progress**: Completed
- **Reflection**: Need to focus on the objective and start working on 2D implementation using NVIDIA Modulus 

---

### 15th November 2024 (Friday)
- **Notes**: Issues: NVIDIA Modulus wheel breaks due to conflicting packages
- **Tasks**: Try different methods such as creating environments on Miniconda
- **Progress**: In spite of the effort, issue exists
- **Reflection**: Driver incompatible, so GPU on laptop was not being used

---

### 5th December 2024 (Thursday)
- **Notes**: GPUs listed on the documentation are mostly NVIDIA Hoppers i.e., GPUs manufactured after 2019 are compatible (not RTX 2080ti)
- **Tasks**: Investigate pull requests and issues on GitHub
- **Progress**: Investigated that NVIDIA Modulus, the deep learning framework, works on Shannon
- **Reflection**: NVIDIA Modulus works on Shannon, but not NVIDIA Modulus.sym. Received help from professor and NVIDIA employee Paul through the forum, by running Modulus on Docker
