## ðŸ“– Introduction
This repository contains the work for a 4th-year BEng project aimed at evaluating the NVIDIA Modulus framework for simulating 2D electromagnetic fields, specifically focusing on transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes. The project compares the performance of Modulus, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework, against the classical Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The primary focus is on understanding the trade-offs between computational efficiency and solution accuracy as the simulation domain size increases, particularly in domains with inhomogeneous material properties.

---

## ðŸ¤” Why NVIDIA Modulus?
Electromagnetic simulations are critical for designing and optimizing devices in fields such as telecommunications, radar systems, and photonics. Traditional numerical methods like FDTD are widely used but can become computationally expensive for large-scale or complex problems. NVIDIA Modulus offers a promising alternative by leveraging deep learning to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) like Maxwell's equations. This project explores the potential of Modulus for 2D electromagnetic simulations, comparing its accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency with FDTD.
